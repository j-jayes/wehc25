If you have any further questions, message the organizing committee at wehc2025@ekh.lu.se.\nThe 20th World Economic History Congress will convene from 28 July–1 August 2025 in Lund, Sweden. The theme for the Congress is Equality and Sustainability Challenges, which highlights some of the central issues facing humanity today and also connects to a broad and diverse range of historical problems. To address both the challenges and to find insights from the historical record for that endeavour, a range of perspectives will be necessary.\nThe IEHA has a particularly strong desire to attract sessions related to this theme. However, submissions are welcome on the economic and social histories of all places and periods, and on the exploration of varied sources and methods, and on the theory and uses of economic history itself. We also invite members to employ and analyse diverse strategies for representing the past.\nSessions may be proposed by any member of the international economic history community, whatever their institutional affiliation or status, as well as by scholars in related disciplines. Given the diversity of our membership, we will consider any submission that advances the study, teaching and public presentation of economic history. We welcome panel proposals that highlight scholarship emerging from economic history, business history, financial history, demographic history, environmental history, global and world history, social history, urban and agrarian history, gender studies, material culture, methodological approaches to historical research, history of economics and economic thought, science and technology studies, and other related fields.\nThe programme of the Lund Congress will be organised on the same principles as previous Congresses. The 5-day Congress will have approximately 180 sessions, with each day divided into time blocks of 90 minutes each (two before lunch and two after lunch). As in the past, it will be possible to combine two sessions into larger coherent units.\nThe session proposals should contain:\n\nName, title, affiliation, and contact information of the session organiser\nPossible co-organisers (optional)\nTitle of the session\nDescription of the session’s aim, contribution, and relevance (max 5,000 characters with blanks)\nResearchers invited to participate in the session, or those already confirmed, and their affiliations"

Eligible are junior and senior scholars who have difficulties getting support from their university or research unity. The WEHC 2025 Organising Committee will evaluate the cost differential between the candidate’s country of origin or professional practice and Sweden.

    "section": "",
    "text": "To promote participation from regions normally less represented at international scientific conferences, the WEHC 2025 has set up a significant support scheme for scholars who have less access to funding than those from OECD countries. Grant holders may present a paper, organize or chair a session, present a Poster, or simply attend the Congress, but priority will be given to those who will play an active part.\nThe organizing committee will offer up to 80 grants to fully cover the Congress registration fee and five nights’ accommodation in Lund. Eligible are junior and senior scholars who have difficulties getting support from their university or research unity. The WEHC 2025 Organising Committee will evaluate the cost differential between the candidate’s country of origin or professional practice and Sweden. The grant will not involve any cash flow to the recipient, who will be given a special code for the Congress registration fee (not for the meals) and prepaid accommodation at Lund University Guest House, Sparta, a 15-minute walk from the Congress venues.\nApply by emailing a short CV (max. 3,000 signs) to wehc2025@ekh.lu.se. State your planned activity during the Congress or if you simply will attend. Enter “Participation grant” in the subject field. The latest day for application is 1 January 2025. If you are applying for this grant, wait with your WEHC registration until we get back to you with a decision and further instructions. Already paid registration fees will not be reimbursed."

As a new initiative, the IEHA invites session proposals from member associations. Sessions can be on any area of economic and social history, but should aim to highlight work by scholars affiliated to member associations – whether those are defined thematically or geographically.\nAssociation sessions allow our member organizations to showcase the work of their scholars in front of a global audience, engaging with new potential members. It also enables member organizations to host meetings without incurring the overhead costs of renting space or basis.\nOther opportunities for member associations to publicise their activities at the meeting will include a dedicated table in the publishers’ area where associations can display literature or copies of their journals. There will also be meeting space available during the breaks for member associations to hold their own organizational meetings.\nThe member society session proposals should contain:\n\nName of the member society proposing the session\nContact information\nTitle of the session\nDescription of the session’s aim, contribution, and relevance (max 5,000 characters with blanks)\nResearchers invited to participate in the session, or those already confirmed, and their affiliations\nPreferred date and time of the session"

The speaker has published books and op-eds presenting new perspectives on the drivers of changing inequality and has shown that at the start of the twentieth century, Sweden was one of Europe’s most unequal countries.\nFriday 1 August 13:00, Stadshallen, Botulfshörnan\nFakta och fiktion om kvinnors arbete i historien\nMalin Nilsson\nOn women’s work and livelihoods throughout history. The speaker, who leads a major research project on spinning in the eighteenth century, challenges the myth of the “tradwife” – historically, women have always worked. The topic is especially timely following the 2023 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences awarded to economic historian Claudia Goldin, whose research focuses precisely on this."
