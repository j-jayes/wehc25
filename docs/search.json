It also enables member organizations to host meetings without incurring the overhead costs of renting space or basis.\nOther opportunities for member associations to publicise their activities at the meeting will include a dedicated table in the publishers’ area where associations can display literature or copies of their journals. There will also be meeting space available during the breaks for member associations to hold their own organizational meetings.\nThe member society session proposals should contain:\n\nName of the member society proposing the session\nContact information\nTitle of the session\nDescription of the session’s aim, contribution, and relevance (max 5,000 characters with blanks)\nResearchers invited to participate in the session, or those already confirmed, and their affiliations\nPreferred date and time of the session\n\nThe deadline for submissions is now closed.

    "text": "The 20th World Economic History Congress will convene from 28 July–1 August 2025 in Lund, Sweden. The theme for the Congress is Equality and Sustainability Challenges, which highlights some of the central issues facing humanity today and also connects to a broad and diverse range of historical problems. To address both the challenges and to find insights from the historical record for that endeavour, a range of perspectives will be necessary.\nThe IEHA has a particularly strong desire to attract sessions related to this theme. However, submissions are welcome on the economic and social histories of all places and periods, and on the exploration of varied sources and methods, and on the theory and uses of economic history itself. We also invite members to employ and analyse diverse strategies for representing the past.\nSessions may be proposed by any member of the international economic history community, whatever their institutional affiliation or status, as well as by scholars in related disciplines. Given the diversity of our membership, we will consider any submission that advances the study, teaching and public presentation of economic history. We welcome panel proposals that highlight scholarship emerging from economic history, business history, financial history, demographic history, environmental history, global and world history, social history, urban and agrarian history, gender studies, material culture, methodological approaches to historical research, history of economics and economic thought, science and technology studies, and other related fields.\nThe programme of the Lund Congress will be organised on the same principles as previous Congresses. The 5-day Congress will have approximately 180 sessions, with each day divided into time blocks of 90 minutes each (two before lunch and two after lunch). As in the past, it will be possible to combine two sessions into larger coherent units.\nThe session proposals should contain:\n\nName, title, affiliation, and contact information of the session organiser\nPossible co-organisers (optional)\nTitle of the session\nDescription of the session’s aim, contribution, and relevance (max 5,000 characters with blanks)\nResearchers invited to participate in the session, or those already confirmed, and their affiliations\n\nThe deadline for submissions is now closed.
