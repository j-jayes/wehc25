### What then?

After the run, we'll cool down and socialize at Inferno. Stick around for as long as you like!

### How to join

To join, please fill out the form below that asks for your name and email address so that we can get in touch with you and have an idea about how many will run. 

This is a social run, and all levels of runners are welcome. We will mark the route with signs, and there will be a few people running at the front and back of the group to make sure that no one gets lost.
