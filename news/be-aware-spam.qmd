# Important Notice: Beware of Potential Spam Emails  

It has come to our attention that some participants may have received an email from an address such as **support@g-travelexperts.com**, claiming to arrange accommodation for the World Economic History Congress 2025 in Lund this July.  

We would like to inform all participants that this email is **not associated** with the World Economic History Congress 2025 or any of its official arrangements. This is likely a spam or phishing attempt.  

To protect yourself, we strongly advise:  

- **Do not reply to such emails.**  
- **Avoid clicking on any links or providing personal information.**  
- **Mark the email as spam and delete it immediately.**  

Please note that all official communication regarding the Congress, including accommodation arrangements, will come directly from our organizing team via our official email address: **wehc2025@ekh.lu.se**.  

We encourage participants to share this information with their networks to ensure that everyone is aware of this issue.  

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding,  
Igor Martins, on behalf of the WEHC 2025 organizing committee
