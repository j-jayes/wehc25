The main registration window for the World Economic History Congress 2025 in Lund has now closed. However, due to many requests from participants who missed the initial deadline, we are briefly reopening registration to accommodate latecomers.

This final window will remain open until June 9th, 2025. Interested participants who have not yet registered may do so via the following link:

[Register here](https://registration.invajo.com/ec5a84b1-c61f-40c5-afed-4ac014734cd7)

We look forward to welcoming all registered participants to Lund in August.
