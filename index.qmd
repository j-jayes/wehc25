The World Economic History Congress (WEHC) is an international and interdisciplinary event, taking place every third year, placing economic history at its core. But the congress also appeal to economists, historians, management scholars, sociologists, demographers, geographers, anthropologists, ethnographists, psychologists, philosophers, and to historians of science and technology, as well as nature and life scientists. All researchers across the world are more than welcome to participate.
 
The theme for the 2025 Congress is Equality and Sustainability Challenges, which highlights some of the central issues facing humanity today and also connects to a broad and diverse range of historical problems. To address both the challenges and to find insights from the historical record for that endeavor, a range of perspectives will be necessary.
 
We welcome you to Lund in July 2025!

### {{< fa people-group >}} Propose a session for the World Economic History Conference 2025

We have a particularly strong desire to attract sessions related to the theme `Equality and Sustainability Challenges`. However, submissions are welcome on the economic and social histories of all places and periods, and on the exploration of varied sources and methods, and on the theory and uses of economic history itself.

### {{< fa people-roof >}} Propose a member association session for the World Economic History Conference 2025

As a new initiative, the IEHA invites session proposals from member associations. Sessions can be on any area of economic and social history, but should aim to highlight work by scholars affiliated to member associations – whether those are defined thematically or geographically.
